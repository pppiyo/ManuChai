# About
A business AI chatbot built for instant, intelligent manufacturing quotes and more, using IBM Granite model via watsonx.ai.

Created from scratch in just 1 days for the IBM Hackathon in June 2025 by a team of four women engineers and close friends.

# Inspiration
Two of our teammates have EPC project experience in engineering industry. They observed that equipment procurement process is still highly manual, relying on excessive human effort and email communication—leading to inefficiencies and delays. We thus see an opportunity to apply AI agents to automate tasks, streamline communication, and improve decision-making—modernizing procurement and driving efficiency in a traditional manufacturing industry.
